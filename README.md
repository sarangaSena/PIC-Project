# PIC Project

Welcome to the open-source PIC project using the PICC. This project is designed to empower developers, from beginners to advanced, by providing accessible resources and tutorials for learning embedded systems development. The goal is to create a collaborative open-source community that supports and encourages learning, sharing, and growing together.

## Project Overview

This project aims to simplify the learning process for the PIC microcontrollers. It starts with the basics of setting up the development environment and progresses to more complex topics such as sensor handling, communication protocols (Bluetooth, MQTT).

The project is structured to help learners at different stages:
- **Beginners:** Get started with the fundamentals of the PIC.
- **Intermediate Learners:** Dive into handling external sensors and implementing communication protocols.
- **Advanced Learners:** Explore real-time systems and complex applications with FreeRTOS.

## Features

- Step-by-step tutorials to guide users from the basics to advanced topics.
- Open-source code repositories for hands-on learning.
- Free access to all resourcesâ€”tutorials, examples, and projects.
- Community-driven contributions, discussions, and feedback.

## How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome! Whether it's improvements to the tutorials, bug fixes, or new feature suggestions, every contribution helps build a more robust learning platform.

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or fix.
